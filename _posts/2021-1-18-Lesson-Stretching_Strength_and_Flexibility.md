# Overview TODO

A online lesson giving over Facebook via the Facebook Rooms functionality

Focus was on gaining flexibility and increasing strength in the 'small' muscles that helps holding a kick in a high position, i.e. holding a kick near the face

The lesson was divided into 3 parts, 1: warm up, 2: static stretching and 3: increasing 'small' muscle strength

## Warm up

> ca. 10 minuets

### Balancing exercises

All is from standing on 1 leg so it has to be done on both sides

- Lift the leg from the ground
- Hold your knee (of the leg that is off the ground)
- Turn to a round house kick while holding the knee (**Dolly Chagi** position)
- Turn to a side kick while holding the knee (**Yop Chagi** position)
- Do the flying swan (TODO: image)

## Dynamic Stretchin

> ca. 15 minuets

Combinations of various high kicks

## Static stretch

> Approximately 18-20 minuets

5 exercises of 60 seconds stretch, 10 seconds to move to the next exercise

### Side split

- Frog Stretch
- Frog Stretch with 1 stretched leg
- Frog Stretch with 1 stretched leg (the other leg)
- Side Split
- Side Split (max out)

### Front split (one for each side)

- The mermaid
- Sitting with one leg bent, and the other one stretched out (TODO: see reference)
- Same as above, but try to reach the leg with the hand over the head (TODO: see image)
- Side Split
- Side Split (max out)

## Final workout

> ca. 15 minuets

Max amount of reps in 3 minuets of

- Burpees
- Push Ups
- Situps
- Squats

## Summary

Now doing all of this in 60 minuets is quite tight, so doing fewer rounds or a very short warm up would be recommended

## Notes

- 18:00 is a bit too early
