# Overview

A online lesson giving over Facebook via the Facebook Rooms functionality

Focus was on gaining flexibility and increasing strength in the ‘small’ muscles that helps holding a kick in a high position, i.e. holding a kick near the face. Small WOD (Workout of the day) was also added to keep the students in shape during lockdown

The lessons consisted of:

1. Very short warm up
2. Two short workouts
3. Static stretch routine
4. Dynamic Stretching
5. 10 minuets AMRAP

## Warm Up

Very light, only to make sure that no one gets an injury from being too 'cold'

## Initial Small Strength Training

- 'Bring Sally Up' with push up (song: Flower by Moby)
- Tabata Burpees

## Static Stretch - Using a Chair

5 exercises of 60 seconds stretch, 10 seconds to move to the next exercise

> ca. 18-20 minuets

### Side Split

- [Side Lunge to one side][SideLungeStretch] (or see: images under references)
- [Side Lunge to the other side][SideLungeStretch] (or see: images under references)
- Side Split
- Side Split and lean to one side
- Side Split and lean to the other side

### Side Split - One For Each Side

- The [mermaid][MermaidStretch] with the bend leg placed on the base of the chair (see picture in references)
- One heel on the base of the chair, stretch that leg and try to get the forehead to the knee
- The same but on the back of the chair (its highest point)

## Dynamic Stretching

- 3x10 repetitions with both legs of **slowly** doing a front kick over the back of the chair as high as possible
- 3x10 repetitions with both legs of **slowly** doing a side kick over the back of the chair and lifting the leg as high as possible
- 3x10 repetitions with both legs of **slowly** lifting the leg from a side kick position from one side of the back of the chair to the other

- (BONUS) 3x10 repetitions with both legs of **slowly** doing a back kick lifting the leg from one side of the chair to the other, over the base

## AMRAP (As Many Rounds As Possible) Ending

> 10 minuets

As Many Rounds As Possible

- 5 Burpees
- 10 push ups
- 10 back extension
- Hold a back extension 30 seconds

## Notes

- The exercises of the AMRAP should be shown on the screen, as it can ve hard to remember
