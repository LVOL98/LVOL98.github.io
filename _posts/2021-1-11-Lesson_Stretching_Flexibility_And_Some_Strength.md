# Overview

A online lesson giving over Facebook via the Facebook Rooms functionality

Focus was on gaining flexibility and increasing strength in the ‘small’ muscles that helps holding a kick in a high position, i.e. holding a kick near the face. Small WOD (Workout of the day) was also added to keep the students in shape during lockdown

The lessons consisted of:

1. Very short warm up
2. Two short workouts
3. Static stretch routine
4. Dynamic Stretching
5. 10 minuets AMRAP

## Warm Up

Very light, only to make sure that no one gets an injury from being too 'cold'

## Initial Small Strength Training

- 'Bring Sally Up' with push up (song: Flower by Moby)
- Tabata Burpees

## Static Stretch - Using a Chair

5 exercises of 60 seconds stretch, 10 seconds to move to the next exercise

### Side Split

- Side Lunge to one side
