# Overview

A online lesson giving over Facebook via the Facebook Rooms functionality

Focus was on gaining flexibility and increasing strength in the 'small' muscles that helps holding a kick in a high position, i.e. holding a kick near the face

The lesson was divided into 3 parts, 1: warm up, 2: static stretching and 3: increasing 'small' muscle strength

## Warm up

> Approximately 5-10 minuets

Light warm up consisting of various kicks to initiate the hip, with some basic arm and lower back exercises i.e. touching your heels over your head, swinging tour arm etc.

## Static stretch

> 5 minuets and 50 seconds per cycle (i.e. doing the 5 exercises with breaks in side split)
> Total approximate: 18-20 minuets

5 exercises of 60 seconds duration with 10 seconds to rest to change exercise, which was done once for side split and once for each side in front split

### Side split

- Squat stretch (sit in a as deep as possible squat position and push your knees as far apart as possible)
- [Squatting leg out/side lunge to one side][SideLungeStretch] (or see: images under references)
- [Squatting leg out/side lunge to the other side][SideLungeStretch] (or see: images under references)
- Regular side split or frog stretch
- Regular side split again

### Front split (one for each side)

- [Mermaid stretch][MermaidStretch] (or see: images under references)
- Lunge stretch with the knee resting at the floor (if it's too easy one can also lift the calf by using the same hand => if left leg is stretched behind then the left hand should be used)
- From standing, both legs stretched and try to get the forehead to touch the knee
- From standing, one leg bent and a little behind the other leg which is stretched and try to get the forehead to reach the knee
- Regular front split

### 3 minuet strech

> 9 minuets

These stretches are meant to push ones flexibility to the max

Do it once for side split and once for each side of front split

## Increase strength of the small muscles

> Approximately 12 minuets

The routine (note: it can help people to have one hand on a wall, in order to help with balance):

- 3 rounds of 10 kicks to each sidewhere the kick is executing while counting to 10 (if there's no enough time, this can be changed to 1 round)
- Hold the kick in the highest position possible for 10 seconds
- Hold the kick in the highest position possible and without losing too much height kick 10 times fast

Now choose some kick that fits the group being taught, I did:

- Front Kick (Ap Chagi)
- Round House Kick (Dollyo Chagi)
- Side Kick (Yop Chagi)

## Summary

Now doing all of this in 60 minuets is quite tight, so doing fewer rounds or a very short warm up would be recommended

## Notes

- Didn't have enough time so had to cut the routing from 3 rounds to 1 round
- Some students thought that training the small muscles was very good, as that is often something that is neglected
- Some students expressed wishes for the inclusion of other muscles groups fx the arms, which could be included in the warm up or as a last power exercise
