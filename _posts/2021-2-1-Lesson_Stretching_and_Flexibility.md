# Overview

A online lesson giving over Facebook via the Facebook Rooms functionality

Focus was on gaining flexibility and increasing strength in the 'small' muscles that helps holding a kick in a high position, i.e. holding a kick near the face, while also adding in a small workout to maintain peoples physical form during the lockdown

The lesson was divided as follows:

1. Warmup with various stances (Jahse)
2. A stretching routine with static stretches
3. Dynamic Stretches to maintain strength
4. Final workout (EMOM)

## Warm Up

> ca. 10 minuets

Do a various stand with techniques for warmup

## Static Stretch

> ca. 18-20 minuets

60 seconds stretch and 10 seconds in between exercises

### Side Split

2. The Frog
3. [Side Lunge Stretch][SideLungeStretch] One Side
4. [Side Lunge Stretch][SideLungeStretch] The Other Side
5. Side Split

## Dynamic Stretch

> ca. 20 minuets

The General flow that is repeated for each side:

- Do 20 kicks (with the support from a wall)
- Hold the leg up and lift it as high as possible (like with side kick (Yop Chagi) hold the kick and lift the leg as high as possible, bring it down again without touching the ground. It's some small lifts)
- Hold the leg for 10 seconds

Which is done for:

meaning that in the first minuet one has to complete 5 burpees and can then take the rest of the minuet as a break, during the second minuet 10 pushups must be completed and then the rest of the minuet is a break, and so on.

3 rounds of the following 4 exercises should be done (3x4 = 12)
