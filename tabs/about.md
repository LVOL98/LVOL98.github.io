## Hi

My name is Lukas and you have found the website where I post my personal projects. As you might have noticed this site could be separated into two categories

## Programming

I'm currently studying the [bachelors degree in Software Development](https://en.itu.dk/programmes/bsc-programmes/software-development) at the [IT University of Copenhagen](https://en.itu.dk/). That's why you can find links to my personal projects like [this one](https://lvol98.github.io/business_card/#/)

## Martial Arts

Another big chunk of my time is spent practicing Shinson Hapkido, which I have been doing for a long time. During that time I've learned a lot and also wondered about many things, hence I decided to collect all of this in various articles, that can be found on this site
