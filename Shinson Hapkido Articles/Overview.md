# A collections of articles about SSH

## Who Am I?

We are all good at talking about ourself which often becomes boring and is completely irrelevant to the subject at hand. Hence this section will be rather short and to the point

The author (me) is a second degree black belt (2. Dan) in the martial art of Shinson Hapkido (__*SSH*__), and have been a practitioner since childhood (to be honest I've lost track)

## 'But why though'

Now the big question: 'But why though'. This is a collection of articles about various topics surrounding SSH including discussion about the philosophical topics that are discussed in the curriculum of the various belt degrees, discussions about teaching experiences and techniques and general considerations in relation to SSH among other things. First and foremost these articles are written to the author (me), as a way to remember important concepts and discoveries during the authors (my) 'SSG career', but the articles are available to everyone as they might be useful for others or might lead to interesting discussion surrounding the topics of the articles

On the off chance that someone finds these articles and wants to get in contact with the author (me), one way is to go to the authors (my) [GitHub page](https://github.com/LVOL98), but if you're not familiar with Github here's my email: lukas98@live.dk

## To come

Currently I'm writing the articles and none is done at the moment, but once they're eventually done, they will be linked below sorted into various topics
